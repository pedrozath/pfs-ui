JSHashtable for nodejs
==================

Port of jshashtable as nodejs package. jshashtable is a standalone implementation of hash table in JavaScript. It associates keys with values, and allows any object to be used as the key (unlike JavaScript's built-in Object, which only allows strings as property names).
